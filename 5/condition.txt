From user @JKphobic on CodeWars (https://www.codewars.com/kata/take-a-ten-minute-walk)

You live in a city where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You have the unfortunate habit of arriving too early or too late to your appointments, so you decide to create a Walk Generating App.

Any time you press the button, it will send you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. [‘n’,’s’,’w’,’e’]). You always walk only a single block in a direction. It takes one minute to traverse one city block.

Create a program that will return an array of one-letter strings representing the walk. The program should accept input for the amount of time the user decides to walk and should bring the user back to their starting location.
